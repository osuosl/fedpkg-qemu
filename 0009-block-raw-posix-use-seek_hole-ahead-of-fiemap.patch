Subject: [PATCH] block/raw-posix: use seek_hole ahead of fiemap
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

try_fiemap() uses FIEMAP_FLAG_SYNC which has a significant performance
impact.

Prefer seek_hole() over fiemap() to avoid this impact where possible.
seek_hole is more widely used and, arguably, has potential to be
optimised in the kernel.
